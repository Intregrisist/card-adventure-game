## Overview

This project was started as a fun exercise to display and practice a wide arrange of skills and at the same time build a fun entertaining game.  Adventure Card game will make use of **AngularJS**  for the client app and **NodeJS** for the server app.

## Progress

This project will develop over time, check periodically for updates to follow the project's development. 

## Client App

The client app will be using **AngularJS** and a custom framework.  The goal here will be to figure out an easy to manage structure for this growing application.

## Server App

We eventually want to make this game be an online multiplayer game, so we will be creating a **NodeJS** server and making use of **Socket.IO** to make our game rooms.
